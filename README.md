# T9-WIKI-2023
This website is a Fact checker using the wikipedia API. It takes a statement from the user, and uses Wikipedia to 
evaluate the validity of the statement. It also provides the user with links to relevant Wikipedia articles based on
their input.

This project was built in 24 hours at CU Boulder's T9 Hackathon.
Our tech stack was HTML, CSS, and vanilla Javascript. We used the Axios HTTP client to handle the API requests.
